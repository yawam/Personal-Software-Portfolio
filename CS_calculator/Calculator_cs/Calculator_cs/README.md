## Overview
# Simple Calculator

This is a fairly new journey for me. Using Visual studio code to seamlessly create an interface and link it to my code.
In doing this, I built a simple calculator that does simple arithmetic. All the logic is in place and is functional.
I did this project in C-sharp and I discovered that visual studio creates all the classes and the relationships for you unless you need to create yours.
I also discovered I can do it in other languages. It's amazing.

Here's a link to a little demo video
