# Overview

{Important! Do not say in this section that this is college assignment. Talk about what you are trying to accomplish as a software engineer to further your learning.}
This is a fairly new journey for me. Using Visual studio code to seemlessly create an interface and link it to my code.
{Provide a description of the software that you wrote to demonstrate the C# language.}
In doing this, I built a simple calculator that does simple arithmetic. All the logic is in place and is functional.
I did this project in C-sharp and I discovered that visual studio creates all the classes and the relationships for you unless you need to create yours.
I also discovered I can do it in othee languages. It's amazing.

Here's a link to a little demo video
