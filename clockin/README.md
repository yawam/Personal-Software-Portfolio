# Overview

In my quest to continue in my react Learning, I decided to start this Clock In project. It's pretty scalable and there's a lot of cool features that can be added to it.
The app is basically a clock In App where employees can enter their names and hit a clock in button and a clock out button to clockOut
There will then be a display to show who clocked in and at what time.

This Software can be used by any company to track employee hours and pay and punctuality
