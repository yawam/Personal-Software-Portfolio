# Overview

In my quest to continue in my react Learning, I decided to start this Clock In project. It's pretty scalable and there's a lot of cool features that can be added to it.
The app is basically a clock In App where employees can enter their names and hit a clock in button and a clock out button to clockOut
There will then be a display to show who clocked in and at what time, calculate the total hours and pay

This Software can be used by any company to track employee hours and pay and punctuality

# Future Work

There's a lot more I can and plan to do on this project

- Create authentication to keep track of users and sessions
