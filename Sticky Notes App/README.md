# Overview

This App is a sticky note app or basically the rudiments or fundamentals of a fully fledged sticky notes app. This project was to help introduce myself to the React eco system. Basically what the program does is to render cards of sticky notes to the page from an array.

## To start
- Run npm install to download Node Modules
- Run cd index.js
- run npm start to run program in terminal

Node modules has already been added to the git ignore folder

# Web Pages

This web app is just one paged for now. However when a new card is created it is automatically rendered on the page

# Future Work

There are a lot of things to work on and include in this app
* Creating a User form to add to the json file
* truncate card information so all the cards are the same size and click to expand view of card
* Split cards by date created.
