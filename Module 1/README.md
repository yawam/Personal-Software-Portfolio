# Overview
In this project I tried to imitate a school database. I work at Student Records and Registration right now and I thought the database program we use was brilliant.
A created this software with a few basic CRUD operations linked to a firebase real-time database in python. That is the aim of this project.
In due course this program can be scalable and can actually go up to production to make a database for a school.
It is also possible to use the tkinter Module to create a GUI for this project( which I will finish and publish later)

The program basically provides a dashboard to ask for an action. Either to add update or delete a student's records. Once again, It is pretty simple but I believe it is very scalable

# Cloud Database
Firebase real-time Database which is a nosql database which stores data in a key:value pair form

# Development Environment

I used Python to develop this program.
I used the pyrebase library,Json library,OS library, dotenv and tkinter(still in work)
